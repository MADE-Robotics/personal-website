        <p>Current QA Test Analyst with a background in Geology. During my time as a Geologist I gained valuable insight into the power that computer programs could have in analyzing and processing information. It was when I left for grad school that I realized I wanted to learn more about how computers could be used in a way that was more creative and less quantitative. I transitioned from Geology into the tech world by starting a position as a QA support technician with Facebook specifically in the Oculus AR/VR department. I then moved up to a position as a QA Test Analyst about nine months later. I’ve had the chance to work on both hardware and software for Quest systems and work the Quest 2 during the full stage of the products life cycle. Currently, I work analyzing internal feedback for a soon to be released app. During my time at Facebook I’ve been introduced to a variety of new technical skills, as well as the affinity for working with prototypes. I am looking to launch a career as a Software Engineer, I’d like to work on innovative products that have the long term goal of improving modern technology. </p>
